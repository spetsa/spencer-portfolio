          <h2>Driving an increase in the adoption of an online paymment processor through variant testing.</h2> <br><br>

          <p>My role at Cevnn (formerly Curexe) was to increase the adoption of our payment processor “SmartPay'' 
            by enterprise clients and customers on ecommerce checkout pages. 
          </p>


          <p>SmartPay was the first payment processor that allowed Canadians to make online payments directly from
             their online bank account through Pre-Authorized Debits (PAD) pulls. This breakthrough process empowered
              SmartPay to offer lower rates than the standard interchange fees of 1.4% - 2.9% and eliminated the risk
               of fraudulent chargebacks for e-commerce stores. As a result, SmartPay attracted many prominent companies 
               such as WalMart, Samsung, Adidas, and countless e-commerce stores.
          </p>

          </figure>
          <br>

          <h3>Analyzing our customer conversion rate</h3>

          <p>We quickly realized that we were unable to determine the conversion rate of SmartPay versus other processors as we 
            could not access the information detailing the total number of checkouts from each store. To address this issue, I 
            worked with the engineering team to develop a plug-in update for a particular no-code e-commerce platform that many of our 
            customers used, that allowed us to track the total number of checkouts by customers. By comparing this data with the 
            number of customers who used SmartPay, we were able to establish an average conversion rate of 6%. While this benchmark 
            did not cover custom installations (most enterprise client sites) and other no-code e-commerce platforms, it provided us 
            with a useful starting point to work from.
          </p>

          <h3>Hypothesizing the problem and solution</h3>

          <p>During a meeting with the engineering team and Head of Marketing, we hypothesized that our low adoption 
            rate may have been due to a lack of brand recognition, particularly in comparison to the other options on our 
            customers’ checkout page: Visa, Mastercard, and Paypal.
          </p>


          <figure>
            <img src="jpeg images/Visa_PayPal.png">
          </figure>

          <p>
            The solution was to quickly build brand recognition and consumer trust. 
            Our challenge was to achieve this with an incredibly small budget. Our entire marketing budget was allocated to b2b,
             not increasing consumer adoption.
          </p>

          <p>
            After leading multiple brainstorming sessions we came up with a simple solution: replace the button 
            on the checkout page, which previously displayed the SmartPay logo, with a button that read "Secure 
            Banking Payment" and included a small image of a building with three pillars to represent a bank.
            I then created several different mockups using Figma, organized a company-wide vote via Slack to select our fovorite, and 
            sent the winner to a designer to refine and enhance.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once we received different variations of the new design, I worked with one of our front-end engineers to create pixel perfect replicas of the
             buttons for production. When they were completed it was time to test.

          <h3>Getting Buy-In from Clients</h3>

          <p>In order to access the total number of transactions during the experiment, we needed buy-in from clients, 
            and an open communication channel to collect all of the data. I collaborated with our sales team, who also 
            served as our customer success agents, to select a diverse group of clients with whom we had strong 
            relationships with. We purposefully avoided sampling bias by including a range of clients, from small 
            e-commerce stores to those doing millions in revenue a month. However, we opted not to include enterprise 
            clients to avoid the bureaucracy involved in gaining their approval. By limiting the study to e-commerce
             stores with less than 50 employees, we were able to obtain approval after a maximum of two meetings while 
             still including stores with significant revenue.

          <h3>Test Scope</h3>

          <p>To ensure we collected enough data, we decided to conduct the experiment for an entire month. I worked 
            with our Lead Engineer to develop a program to deploy the test and track all data. The program worked by 
            displaying one of the four payment buttons (the original and three test variants) when the checkout page
             was loaded, documenting which button was displayed, and if the customer transacted using SmartPay during
              that session. Although the buttons were randomly selected, the program was designed to display each button 
              approximately 25% of the time. By tracking how many times each button was displayed and whether the 
              customer completed the transaction during that session, we could accurately establish whether any of the
               buttons had a higher conversion rate than the others.
          </p>

          <h3>Results and findings</h3>

          <p>After analyzing the historical transaction data we found that the original button had a conversion
             rate of slightly over 6% before the tests, and 5.5% conversion rates during the tests, indicating a similar
              performance. However, the new buttons we introduced achieved conversion rates between 11% and 12.5%, a 
              substantial increase in adoption. What was even more interesting was users who made purchases of less than
               $40 were 20% more likely to select our payment option. Lastly, we observed that our button was clicked 17%
                of the time, but experienced a significant drop-off rate when users reached the subsequent page where they
                 had to select their bank. This gave us a hypothesis for our next test — by simplifying the bank
                  connection process or designing a cleaner-looking page, we could increase adoption even further. 
          </p>

          <figcaption>Editor's Note: I couldn't locate copies of the redesigned buttons. For effect, I recreated them from memory.</figcaption>
