          <h2>Launching an advertising platform in a new market.</h2> <br><br>


          <p>
            Portl Media is a Toronto based company that runs interactive advertising tablets placed in the back
             of Ubers and Lyfts. The company ran advertisements for brands such as NBCU, Nestle, Duracell and others.
              At the time of this Case Study Portl was only live in Toronto.
          </p>

          <br>

            <img src="jpeg images/Portl_01.webp">
            <figcaption>Portl's homepage.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <br>

          <p>
            At Portl, I climbed the ranks from AE, to Head of Client Strategy, to the Head of Operations.
             As the recently promoted Head of Operations, my mission was to launch Portl in Philadelphia, 
             within three weeks, with ads and content specific to the Philly market.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            With the founders focused on fundraising and maintaining the Toronto ecosystem (drivers, tablets, ad sales), 
            I had to spearhead this project independently. To further complicate things, we did not have any technical 
            employees to make the necessary product updates for the Philadelphia launch, nor did we have a network of Philly
             drivers with our tablet installed, the only thing we did have were advertisers and content providers 
             (NBCU, Donut Media, Philadelphia Tourism) who were expecting us to go live ASAP.

          </div>
        </div>
         </p>


          <h3>Accessing the Drivers</h3>

          <p>
            To get the Portl tablets in front of riders, I had to recruit drivers who completed at least 50 rides per week. 
            This was the minimum threshold to cover the operating costs of the tablet. More rides meant more passengers seeing 
            the ads, which resulted in more revenue.
          </p>

          <p>
            I launched and a/b tested Facebook ads to target drivers in Philly Uber Driver groups and created look-a-like audiences based on 
            their demographics. We then directed those who engaged with our ads to a survey where they could enter contact 
            information, answer questions about their weekly rides, and willingness to install a tablet in their vehicle.
          </p>

          <br>

            <figcaption>Some of the images used in the Facebook campaigns.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <br>

          <p>
            Those drivers who met our standards were automatically added to a Hubspot sales funnel where we would reach out 
            to them once the product was ready for launch, while the rest were kept in a list for later use if necessary. The 
            contact information for those who filled out the survey was uploaded to Facebook and disqualified from seeing our 
            ads again to ensure we wouldn't waste ad spend on already converted drivers. 
          </p>

          <h3>Getting Technical</h3>

          <p>
            Hiring technical employees can be challenging, especially when there is a time constraint to launch a product. 
            To expedite the process, I visited local accelerators to find a technical founder who was interested in making
             extra money on the side. These individuals often understand the urgency of launching a functional product quickly.
          </p>

          <p>
            The initial code was written by an inexperienced engineer, resulting in little documentation and many hard-coded
             features. To improve the product, we decided to update it in three steps. 
          </p>

          <p>
            1. Firstly, we planned to clone the initial Toronto repository and adjust the hard coded content display with new 
            content for the Philly version. This would enable us to launch the Philly version quickly and without risking any
             interference with the Toronto version.
          </p>

          <p>
            2. Once live, we would update the product to display each region’s content through a Content Management System 
            (CMS). The CMS would enable us to automatically swap the content inventory based on the device’s geo-location,
             thus running all locations off of the same code-base and repository.
          </p>

          <figure>
            <img src="jpeg images/Phillies_homescreen.png">
            <figcaption>An example of a region specific ad on Portl's lockscreen.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            3. Finally, we wanted to create a smoother user experience by uploading content directly to the tablet’s storage,
             rather than perpetually streaming content, which was the current state of the platform. This would eliminate buffer 
             times for video content and app animations.
          </p>


          <h3>Installation & optimizing</h3>

          <p>
            Once the initial Philly version of the app was ready to launch with the proper content offerings myself and the
             developer installed the app on the tablets and prepared to launch.
          </p>

          <p>
            To install the tablets we reached out to the drivers who met our standards through automated email campaigns
             containing a Calendly link for installation. We conducted A/B testing on the emails to optimize for open and
              booking rates. We emphasized the benefits of installing the tablet, such as an increase in reviews and tips,
               to encourage adoption. For those who did not book an installation, we followed up with phone calls to ensure we
                converted as many drivers as possible.
          </p>

          <figure>
            <img id="portlinstall" src="jpeg images/portl_installation.png">
            <figcaption>A driver in Philly with a Portl tablet installed.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            To remind drivers of their installation appointments, we sent multiple messages 3 days before, the day before,
             5 hours before, 1 hour before, and 10 minutes before the scheduled time. Our initial attendance rate was 50%,
              but we increased attendance to 70% by offering a free installation if they showed up for their scheduled time,
               but a $30 installation fee if they canceled and still wanted the tablet.
          </p>

          <p>
            To further streamline the process, we redirected high-value drivers who completed our survey to a Calendly
             link for immediate installation booking after qualification. This led to a 40% increase in conversion from
              qualified to installed drivers.
          </p>

          <h3>In Conclusion</h3>

          <p>
            Despite encountering challenges along the way, we managed to successfully launch in Philadelphia and meet our
             ambitious 3-week deadline. Additionally, within six weeks, we had more than 60 screens up and running, and the
              Developer we hired completed all the app updates within the same timeframe. Overall, launching Portl Media in the
               Philadelphia turned out to be a highly rewarding experience that taught me the importance of creative problem
                solving and acting with urgency.
